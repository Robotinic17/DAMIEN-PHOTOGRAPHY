# Welcome Developers 👋

I’ve already created the **project template and structure**.  
Please read this carefully and follow the guide below.

---

## Project Structure

- **HTML & CSS** → handled by **Me and Ruth**
- **JavaScript & Complex Logic** → handled by **Me and Isaac**
- Fonts and colors are already set up in the HTML/CSS.  
  => Please **use the existing styles** instead of creating new ones.

## 🛠️ How to Get Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you don’t know how to clone a repo yet, here’s the step:

1. Copy the repository link from GitHub (green **Code** button → HTTPS link).
2. Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```

````

3. Move into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```

Now you have the project on your local machine.

### 2. Workflow

* Always **pull the latest changes** before working:

  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```
* After making your changes:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "your message here"
  git push origin main
  ```

---

## Guidelines

* Stick to the existing folder/file structure.
* Reuse the **fonts and colors** already defined.
* Communicate if you’re not sure about something.

Keep the positive vibes guys.
